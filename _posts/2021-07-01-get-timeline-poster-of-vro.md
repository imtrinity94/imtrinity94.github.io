Hello folks,
I would like to share with you an infographic that I have created with lot of hardwork over a course of 2 days. It's a poster\infographic of how vRealize Orchestartor evolved over time. Since 2007, when VMware bought Dunes Technology to 2021 when vRO become an industry leading orchestration tool worldwide. Its basically a very detailed timeline of that course. Feel free to share and show me some love.
